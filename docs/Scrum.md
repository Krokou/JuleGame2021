# Scrum Practices
The project will utilize the following sprint program:

## 1 Week Sprints
## Weekly Sprint Planning Meetings on Monday
During this meeting the team will discuss:
- What to do
  - Who will do it
  - Time estimation
  - Deadline
- Whatever else comes up
## Daily Standups
The team will hold daily standup meetings every morning. During these meetings, the team will present and discuss...
- What has been done
- What will be done today
- What do we need help with
The motivation for these meetings is better communication, and a tight bond between the developers, so as to make it easier for everyone to help eachother out.
## Retrospectives on Mondays
Before the weekly sprint planning meetings, a retrospective will be held. During these meetings, the team will discuss:
- How has the week been?
  - What went well?
  - What can we improve on?
  - How did we do on last week's focus points?
- What will next week's 3 focus points be?
The motivation for the retrospectives is to improve on the development process as we go. Every team works differently, and adjustments should therefore be made. Also it's christmas.
